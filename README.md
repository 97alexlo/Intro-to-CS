## Conway's game of life and the Sierpinski triangle
Takes in a user input of: number of rows of gameboard, number of columns of gameboard, number of generations, and an initial state of the gameboard [(see inputFile.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/Conway_Sierpinski/inputConway.txt). Generates a different pattern on the gameboard with each board being a function of the previous

## Polynomial Solver
Takes in a user input of 1 to 5 coefficients for a polynomial [(see inputPolynomial.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/Polynomial_Solver/inputPolynomial.txt) and an initial estimate of its root and displays a table of approximations using Newton's Method

## Rectangle Gaskets
Wrote a class that can be used to build rectangle gaskets that can be displayed graphically

## Random Fill
Takes in a seed and a number of rows for a 2D array. Dynamically allocates a 1D and 2D array and calls a function to generate random number from 10 - 50. Fills them in the 2D array and calculates the sum of each column and fills them in the 1D array. Displays both arrays.
