## Conway's game of life and the Sierpinski triangle
Takes in a user input of: number of rows of gameboard, number of columns of gameboard, number of generations, and an initial state of the gameboard [(see inputFile.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/Conway_Sierpinski/inputConway.txt). Generates a different pattern on the gameboard with each board being a function of the previous

## Polynomial solver
Takes in a user input of 1 to 5 coefficients for a polynomial [(see inputPolynomial.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/Polynomial_Solver/inputPolynomial.txt) and an initial estimate of its root and displays a table of approximations using Newton's Method

## Rectangle gaskets
Wrote a class that can be used to build rectangle gaskets that can be displayed graphically

## Random fill
Takes in a seed and a number of rows for a 2D array. Dynamically allocates a 1D and 2D array and calls a function to generate random number from 10 - 50. Fills them in the 2D array and calculates the sum of each column and fills them in the 1D array. Displays both arrays.

## Print pattern
Uses recursion to print a triangle pattern of the square of integers

## Sin(3x) approximations
Produces a table with each row showing the values of x, the value of sin(3x) evaluated in three different ways, and some differences between the results of the different methods of calculation of sin (3x)
