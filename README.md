## Conway's game of life and the Sierpinski triangle
Takes in an input of: number of rows of gameboard, number of columns of gameboardboard, number of generations, and an initial state of the gameboard [(see inputFile.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/inputConway.txt). Generates a different pattern in each gameboard with each board being a function of the previous

## Polynomial Solver
Takes in a user input of 1 to 5 coefficients for a polynomial [(see inputPolynomial.txt)](https://github.com/alexlo97/Programming-projects/blob/master/inputPolynomial.txt) and an initial estimate of its root and displays a table of approximations using Newton's Method

## Rectangle Gaskets
Wrote a class that can be used to build rectangle gaskets that can be displayed graphically
